Lambda expressions
1. (int x, int y) -> x+y; or (x, y) -> x + y; which one of these is a valid lambda expression?

3. Sort the array in terms of their absolute value: [-1, 2. 23, -19, -100, 20, 203, -102, 0]


Default methods
Default methods are mainly useful in Evolving APIs in a compatible way. Chapter 13 from Modern Java in action has a nice explanation on default methods. Here are a few questions: 
1. Can we make the Default method static in Java?
2. Can an interface contain more than one Default method?
3. Can default method override equals(), hashCode() or toString() from Object class?
4. Can we declare Default methods inside a class in Java?
5. Try to find some other use cases of default methods.
