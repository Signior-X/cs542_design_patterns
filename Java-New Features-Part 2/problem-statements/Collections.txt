A school has n sections in 10th std, for every section, a student list is maintained which consists of the student's name, roll number and marks. For internal purposes the school wishes to maintain these n sections sorted in an order such that:
	1. A section with higher average marks should be placed earlier.
	2. If two sections have an equal average marks score, then the class with less number of students is preferred
	3. In every section students should be sorted according to their roll number

Implement a data structure using collections in Java to support this in such a way that new sections can be added whenever needed and the sorted order of these sections is still maintained.
